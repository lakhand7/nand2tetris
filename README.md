Build a Modern Computer using First Principles
Main goals accomplished:

1. Designed an ALU to perform a whole set of arithmetic and logical operations.
2. Build the computer's main memory (RAM) by going bottom-up from elementary flip-flop gates to one-bit registers to n-bit registers 
   to a family of RAM chips.
3. Wrote an Assembler to translate the low-level machine language to a series of binary codes.
4. Assembled all the building blocks into a general purpose 16-bit computer called Hack.

Note: Check out "branches" for more details and the code.
